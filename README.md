# Warning
> This plugin is unmaintained & obsolete: Please see [this issue](https://github.com/asciidisco/Backbone.Marionette.Handlebars/issues/7) & this [ST thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19863285/using-precompiled-handlebars-templates-with-marionette#) if you want to use Handlebars templates with Marionette (and optional AMD)

Backbone.Marionette.Handlebars
==============================

Spice up your [Backbone.Marionette](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette) application with some [handlebars](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/) flavour

This is a tiny library which overrides some of backbone.marionettes internal 
template functions to make it compatible with handlebars templates.

This especially is very usefull if your using the amd version of marionette and 
Alex Sextons genius strike, the [require-handlebars-plugin](https://github.com/SlexAxton/require-handlebars-plugin).
If you don´t know any of this projects listed above, I highly recommend
to check them out.

Currently i´ve only tested this within an requirejs based amd ecosystem,
but it should also be working within a commonjs or vanilla js based project. 
See the usage section for more details.

## Backbone Marionette < 0.9.x
If you need support for Backbone.Marionette versions lower then 0.9.x,
please grab the plugin version that´s been tagged with v0.1.0 or download the
0.1.0 zip archive from the downloads section.


## Future Features
Currently the plugin does not support loading templates via XHR requests
on its own. 
Didn´t needed this by now, but support will be added in the future.

Same for selector based template retrival like marionette does for templates,
hold on, i will cover this in the future.

Also, writing unit tests (like i always do for my projects, and so should you ;))
is smth. i would like to add as soon as possible. With tests, there will be also an Travis CI integration.

## Installation

### Source Code And Downloads

You can download the raw source code from the "src" folder above, or grab one of the
builds from the root directory. 

To get the latest stable release, use these links which point to the 'master' branch's
builds:

Development: [backbone.marionette.handlebars.js](https://raw.github.com/asciidisco/backbone.marionette.handlebars/master/backbone.marionette.handlebars.js)
Production: [backbone.marionette.handlebars.min.js](https://raw.github.com/asciidisco/backbone.marionette.handlebars/master/backbone.marionette.handlebars.min.js)

### VOLO
```shell
$ volo add Backbone.Marionette.Handlebars
```

### NPM
```shell
$ npm install Backbone.Marionette.Handlebars
```

## Integration
Note: This plugin is UMD compatible, you can use it in node, amd and vanilla js envs (hopefully, not tested, see the section below for more information)

### Vanilla JS
```html
<script src="underscore.js"></script>
<script src="backbone.js"></script>
<script src="handlebars.js"></script>
<script src="backbone.marionette.js"></script>
<script src="backbone.marionette.handlebars.js"></script>
```

### Node
```javascript
var _ = require('underscore');
var Backbone = require('backbone');
var Marionette = require('backbone.marionette');
var MarionetteHandlebars = require('backbone.marionette.handlebars');
```

### AMD
```javascript
define(['underscore', 'backbone', 'backbone.marionette', 'backbone.marionette.handlebars'], function (_, Backbone, Marionette, MarionetteHandlebars) {
});
```

## Usage

### Use with SlexAxtons require-handlebars-plugin

A simple example how to a handlebars template to your marionette view:

```javascript
define([
    'jquery',
    'underscore',
    'backbone',      
    'backbone.marionette',
    'backbone/backbone.marionette.handlebars',          
    'hbs!Template/category',       
],
    function ($, _, Backbone, Marionette, MarionetteHandlebars, categoryTpl) {
        return Backbone.Marionette.ItemView.extend({

            template: {
                type: 'handlebars',
                template: categoryTpl
            }

        });

    });

```

### Configuring globally with requirejs.config()

You can optionally configure Backbone.Marionette.Handlebars to be loaded before all template
views, which removes the need to depend on it in every single view. This ensures that the plugin
can augment default Marionette templating behavior before any templates are required. Add the plugin
to your requirejs.config().

```javascript
deps: [ "backbone.marionette.handlebars" ]
```


Please be aware of that the backbone.marionette.js file should be aliased
as 'backbone.marionette' in the paths config for your require ecosystem.
(Backbone.Marionette.Handlebars expects it to be referenced like this, when it requires it as
a dependency) 

### Use within a non amd ecosystem

A simple example how to a handlebars template to your marionette view, when not using an amd loader:

!Warning: This is not tesed, writing some unit tests to cover this use case is on my list ;)

```javascript
var tmpl = 
var MyView = Backbone.Marionette.ItemView.extend({
    template: {
        type: 'handlebars',
        template: Handlebars.compile(tmpl)
    }
});


```

Please be aware of that the backbone.marionette.js file should be aliased
as 'backbone.marionette' in the [paths config](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config-paths) 
for your require ecosystem. (Backbone.Marionette.Handlebars expects it to be referenced like this,
when it requires it as a dependency)

```javascript
paths: {
    'backbone.marionette' : 'vendor/backbone.marionette'
}
```

## Compatibility And Requirements

Theses libraries are required for the use, development, testing and
documentation of Backbone.Marionette.Handlebars.

### Runtime Requirements

## Build Tools Used

I use a number of tools to build, test and maintain Backbone.Marionette.Handlebars, including
but not limited to:

### Grunt

The [Grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) project is used
to generate the builds for Backbone.Marionette.Handlebars.

### Annotated Source Code

I'm using [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/) to generate the annotated source code together
with the great [DocMaps](http://docmaps.io) service.
